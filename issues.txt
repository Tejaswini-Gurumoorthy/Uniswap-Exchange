1. If txn not being sent, lower the version of ethers
2. Alchemy/Infura API can't "get" signers- use .connect instead of .getSigner().
3. Do not run the createWallets file again, it will create 10 random wallets again.
4. Native ETH cannot be exchanged directly. They need to be wrapped to match the ERC20 standards, and then can be exchanged. (when TokentoToken exchange method used)
5. If eth not wrapped, use the method ethToToken.
6. Always check if funds>= gasLimit*gasPrice + value.
7. Don't enter gas price manually, calculate it using gasLimit, value and funds available. 
8. Insufficient gas funds error because the swapping transaction was taking place before getting funded.

Learnings:
1. Don't run funding and swapping transactions in the same file while testing. If the swapping transaction fails and the funding one suceeds, unnecessary ether transfers take place.
2. estimate the gas first by calling the .estimateGas function, and then use that value for the swapping transaction.
